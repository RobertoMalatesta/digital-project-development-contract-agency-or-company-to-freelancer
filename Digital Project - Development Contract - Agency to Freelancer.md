# Digital Project - Development Contract
## Company/Agency to Freelance Web Developer

Between "us" (or "we") **[your company name]** of **[your company address]** registered in **[England & Wales OR Scotland OR your registered country]** with company number **[your company number]**

and

"you" **[freelancer name / company name]** of **[freelance company address]** [optional: registered in **[England & Wales OR Scotland OR freelance registered country]**] [optional: with company number **[your company number]**]

## Summary: 

As an agnecy we like to build professional, long-term and positive work relationships, 'professional friends' if you will, both internally and with external parties. We know that you'll do your best to fulfil our needs and meet our expectations (and vice-versa), but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

We are contracing you to provide **[front-end development and/or back-end development and/or technical lead/architect ...] services for a **[digital project and/or mobile app ...]** on a **[whitelabel sub-contractor or public sub-contractor basis]** on our client project **[project name]**.

We've discussed timelines and prices during previous correspondence and further on in this contract - but in summary we have agreed the above services to take as estimated total of **[total time]** with an estimated total price of **[total price]**.

Of course it's a little more complicated, but we'll detail that further in this contract and throughout the project.


## What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and you’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. You’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that you'll maintain the confidentiality of everything we give you.

*Us:* We’ll give you everything you need to complete the project as and when and in the format you need it (as discussed). We’ll review your work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so we’ll also be bound by dates we set together. We also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.


## Getting down to the nitty gritty 

### Project kick-off, Project Management

We work using [a(n) agile/scrum/waterfall/gantt/kanban/prince2/etc] [strict/influenced] approach on projects, meaning that you can expect from us: 

- a kick-off meeting, usually accompanied by coffee, where we will discuss the brief, project plan and scheudle and exchange notes
- regular scrums/catch-ups [in person/by Skype/by email], optionally accompanied by coffee, where we will discuss progress and exchange notes, on a schedule agreed upon in the project kick-off meeting
- milestone/phase/commit/release QA and sign-off in an agile/continous development style
- soft-release QA and sign-off
- launch-release QA and sign-off
- [add/amend/delete project variables]

You agree to attend and input to the above, making sure that the project progresses appropriately to maintain the schedule.


### Design 

[We will provide you with designs/We require you to create designs] and notes for all views and interaces - where needed. [We will/you agree to] create designs with [responsive/adaptive/flexible] layouts that suit the features of the project brief and capabilities of many devices and screen sizes and provide design & development notes and annotations.

Where appropriate [we/you] will save time by replicating similar views and interfaces later at the development stage, noting these similar pages on the design files and making sure all content is available. Basically if there are a number of views/pages/interfaces using shared elements and templates, these can be built rather than designs. From time to time a client will need to see every page mocked up, but we can discuss interactive (built) mockups to save time in the longrun.

You and us will welcome constructive two-way review of designs throughout to enable the best outcome. [You/We] will share designs using [Google Drive/Dropbox/One Drive/GitHub/etc] and keeop you updated with progress throughout design stage.

### Content

#### Copy
Copy and text will be [provided by us/written by you] in both designs and notes documents. [You/We] will enter text as per original discussions (for the first version of the website) into views/interfaces/CMS. [We have agreed a separate cost for copywriting services].

#### Imagery / Photography

[We/You] will (where required/appropriate/possible) supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. [We/You] should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. All stock imagery purchased [will be provided by us to you/should be provided to us by you] in high-res formats included notes and proof of useage licenses. 


### Development

By adopting [a(n) phased/agile style/etc] development process we can have two continual two-way review of project progress and release versions of the code for testing and client approval [throughout/at agreed milestones during] the project.

If, at any stage, we’re not happy with the direction your work is taking, we'll discuss a fair payment for the work produced until that point and cancel this contract.

#### Code, Features, Frameworks, Systems, Versioning & Programming Languages
We will detail the requirments for the code, development of features, integration of plugins, frameworks, systems, versioning and programming languages in pre-contract discussions and during project kick-off and scrums/catchups, but in summary the project requires:

- [list of code, features, frameworks, programming language and any other (technical based) variables]
- [ CMS requirements ]
- [ Versioning (GitHub, SVN server etc) ]
- [ etc...]

Also, the most modern versions of everything should be considered for us (for example HTML5, CSS2.1 + 3 where needed, best-practive JavaScript, feature detection and adaptation, poly-fils and behaviours etc) to enable an up-to-date (technically), secure and high-quality end product. 

We love to adopt new technologies in projects, but these should be agreed between first at project kick-off and scrum/catchup meetings.

#### Testing and QA

##### Responsive Device & Browser testing and QA

Browser testing no longer *just* means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It *also* means ensuring that a person’s experience of a view/interface/app should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

##### Desktop browser testing

We require our projects to work in all current variations of major desktop browsers and operating systems including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer AND Edge), Mozilla Firefox and Opera on Windows (9+), Mac OS (10+).

We also require that projects are tested to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9+ for Windows users functions to a high-quality appropriate, possibly adapted, experience. We don't require our projects to work in older (below 9) versions of Internet Explorer unless otherwise specified pre-conract and at project kick-off meetings. Appropraite additional fees for development of adaptive browser features should be agreed before the start of development.

##### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a view/interface/app is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our work in:

iOS: Safari, Google Chrome 
Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox
Windows Mobile 10.x: Edge, and if available at time of this contract Google Chrome and Firefox

Additional appropriate fees should be discussed before the start of development should the project require testing on Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile or another non-standard mobile browsers.


#### Hosting, Technical support and Deployment

[We will procure/You should adivse us on the procurement of] a [web and/or app and/or cloud and/or email ...] hosting company. Support and maintence for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting [will be procured by us/should be advised by you].

[We/You] have professional hosting and [we/you] will manage that hosting for this project. [We/You] will [setup/not-need] remote access to any. We can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you. 


### Changes and revisions 

We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate estimate for that.

### Legal stuff 

We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 
Phew.

### Copyrights 

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you’ve permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You’ll own the visual elements that we create for this project. We’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we’re not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them. 

We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we’ll license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

We love to show off our work and share what we’ve learned with other people, so we reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

### Payments 

We’re sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.

[Payment schedule]

### But where’s all the horrible small print? 

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of [English and Welsh] courts. 

Oh and don’t forget those men with big dogs.

### The dotted line 

Signed by: [your name]

On behalf of: [your company name] 

Date: [date]


Signed by: [freelance name]

[optional: On behalf of: [freelance company name]]

Date: [date]

Everyone should sign above and keep a copy for their records.
